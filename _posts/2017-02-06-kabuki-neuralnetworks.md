A few experiments with neural networks on a collection of Japanese woodcut playbills.

A zoomable visualization of thumbnails in the Kabuki playbills collection, clustered by image similarity as determined by a neural network: [http://babylon.library.ucla.edu/~broadwell/ehon_banzuke/zoomified/](http://babylon.library.ucla.edu/~broadwell/ehon_banzuke/zoomified/)

An interactive similarity map of the inner pages of the kabuki playbills, using neural network and traditional computer vision to determine similarity. Darker cells = more similar: [http://babylon.library.ucla.edu/~broadwell/banzuke_sim/merged.html](http://babylon.library.ucla.edu/~broadwell/banzuke_sim/merged.html)
