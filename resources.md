### Public Collections Data from GLAM Institutions
Many institutions have made collections publicly available as bulk downloads or via APIs. A comprehensive listing is beyond the scope of this site, but here are a few high-profile examples:
- The [Carnegie Hall performance records](https://github.com/CarnegieHall/linked-data) as Linked Open Data
- The New York Philharmonic [performance history](https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory) records
- 130,000 [metadata records](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection) from the Museum of Modern Art's collections
- The [Rijksmuseum](https://old.datahub.io/dataset/rijksmuseum) has made hundreds of thousands of records and high-quality images from its collections available via an API
- The [Linked Jazz](https://linkedjazz.org/) project -- includes some exploratory visualizations as well

<!-- ### Collections Data Downloads

Where possible, the UCLA Library is making bulk download of collections data available via GitHub. To view and download available datasets, visit [https://github.com/collectionslab/collections_data](https://github.com/collectionslab/collections_data)

We've just started adding datasets, so please check back for more! -->

### Tools for Extracting Collections Data

The goal of Collections Lab is to encourage research, learning, and experimentation with collections as data. To this end, we are collecting and sharing scripts that make it (relatively) easy for users to extract collections data for digital collections for various institutions, including the Library of Congress Digital Collections and the Internet Archive. Find these on GitHub here:
[https://github.com/digitalcollectionslab/scripts](https://github.com/digitalcollectionslab/scripts)

<!-- ### Request Collections Data

Users can request metadata for certain collections published via UCLA Digital Collections, Calisphere, and other projects such as the International Digital Ephemera (IDEP) Project. To request collection data for a specific collection, please complete the [Collections Data Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc2pumvTBullCdA8bA5lgFPwb1i17lukOPBTgRXJguBIXVQsA/viewform?usp=sf_link). -->

### Crowdsourcing Collections Data

Crowdsourcing methods and platforms are another way of generating/collecting data from collections. GLAM institutions or scholars can call on academic communities and the general public to enhance collections data to facilitate discovery, research, and teaching. This might be as simple as adding description to a formatted spreadsheet, or may involve using a platform for crowd- or scholar-sourcing description contributions. [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org) is a popular platform for crowd-sourcing transcription and tagging of textual or pictorial images. [Transkribus](https://transkribus.eu) is another hosted solution for collaborative transcription and incorporates Handwritten Text Recognition.

### Always Already Computational: Collections as Data
- A grant-funded [project](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/) involving many libraries and memory institutions, dedicated to "encouraging reuse of collections that support computationally-driven research and teaching."
- So far, this effort has been dedicated primarily to theoretical discussions, but it's worth following.
