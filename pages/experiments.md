## Experiments and projects at other institutions

### NYPL (New York Public Library) Labs
- [**Public Domain Collections**](https://www.nypl.org/research/collections/digital-collections/public-domain): More than 180,000 items in the NYPL's Digital Collections are in the Public Domain and have been made available for download, remixes, and these impressive [visualizations](http://publicdomain.nypl.org/pd-visualization/).
- The NYPL Labs did many other ambitious [projects](https://www.nypl.org/blog/2014/09/03/generative-ebook-covers), several of which used data from their extensive digital collections.

### Yale University Library Digital Humanities Lab
- [Photogrammar](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/): A web-based platform for organizing, searching and visualizing the 170,000 photographs created by the United States Farm Security Administration and Office of War Information (FSA-OWI) from 1935â€“1945.
- [Neural Neighbors](https://yaledhlab.github.io/neural-neighbors/): A project underway to "enable users to identify visual similarity at scale across collections of photographs and videos," focused on the Beinecke Library's vast Meserve-Kunhardt Collection of nineteenth-century photographs.

### Public Collections Data
Many other libraries and institutions have made some potentially very interesting collections (though sometimes only the metadata) publicly available as bulk download or linked open data (LOD) sources, but have not done significant analyses or visualizations. A comprehensive listing is beyond the scope of this site, but here are a few high-profile examples:
- The [Carnegie Hall performance records](https://github.com/CarnegieHall/linked-data) as Linked Open Data
- The New York Philharmonic [performance history](https://github.com/nyphilarchive/PerformanceHistory) records
- 130,000 [metadata records](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection) from the Museum of Modern Art's collections
- The [Rijksmuseum](https://old.datahub.io/dataset/rijksmuseum) has made hundreds of thousands of records and high-quality images from its collections available via an API
- The [Linked Jazz](https://linkedjazz.org/) project -- includes some exploratory visualizations as well

### Always Already Computational: Collections as Data
- A grant-funded [project](https://collectionsasdata.github.io/) involving many libraries and memory institutions, dedicated to "encouraging reuse of collections that support computationally-driven research and teaching."
- So far, this effort has been dedicated primarily to theoretical discussions, but it's worth following.
