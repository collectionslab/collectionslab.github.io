### Collections data

Where possible, the UCLA Library is making bulk download of collections data available via GitHub. To view and download available datasets, visit [https://github.com/collectionslab/collections_data](https://github.com/collectionslab/collections_data)

We've just started adding datasets, so please check back for more!

### Tools for extracting collections data

The goal of Collections Lab is to ecourage research, learning, and experimentation with collections as data - no matter where the data is stored. To this end, we are sharing scripts that make it (relatively) easy for users to extract collections data for digital collections beyond UCLA Library, including the Library of Congress Digital Collections and the Internet Archive. These are available via GitHub:

### Request collections data

Users can request metadata for certain collections published via UCLA Digital Collections, Calisphere, and other projects such as the International Digital Ephemera (IDEP) Project. To request collection data for a specific collection, please complete the [Collections Data Request Form](/request-form).
